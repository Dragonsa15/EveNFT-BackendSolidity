# EveNFT-BackendSolidity

## Getting Started

First you must compile and migrate the contracts

```bash
truffle develop
> compile
> migrate
```

Note , here you must be having the FrontEnd part of this application present at the repo [FrontEnd](https://github.com/DaKeiser/canvas), since the contract json is stored in the frontend folder repo (contracts)
